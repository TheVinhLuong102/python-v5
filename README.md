# Python For V5

By using certain libraries and build tools it is possible to compile and run and python code on V5, EDR and IQ robots.

# Build Tool

There is a command line tool available for building/compiling the code if you wish to use your own IDE (eg. VS Code).

The documentation for the command line tool is avialable here:

https://docs.robotmesh.com/rmbuild-usage

However to build and run a file on your V5 brain simply plug it into your computer via USB and run the following line in the CMD:

```
rmbuild v5 filename.py
```

# RobotMesh IDE

# More Examples

For more examples than the ones provided please check out my main vex robotics repositiory https://github.com/dombarter/choochoochoo where you can see the code for the 2018-2019 Turning Point game. 

If you have trouble with the documentation I would also recommend downloading the robot mesh IDE for a little while as this really helps with autocomplete and setting up parameters correctly.
